<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
<p><strong><mark>This</mark> recipe makes quick</strong>, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em><br>
    <em>A dash of <u>olive oil</u></em><br>
</p>
<h2>Instruction</h2>
<p>
    remove the skin of the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove oil the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    Process all the ingredient into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    if you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>

    For a different flavour you try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime chipotle,
    harisse and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.
